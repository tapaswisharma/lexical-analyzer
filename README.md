# lexical-analyzer



The purpose of the Lexical Analyzer program is to convert a sequence of letters, usually arranged in lines, into a stream of lexical tokens. This involves tokenizing source code words and punctuation symbols. The main objective of the project is to generate a sequence of tokens from a C file that can be used in the subsequent compilation stage. The program should also handle any error requirements that may arise during tokenization.
